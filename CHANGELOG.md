## Unreleased

- Changed the behavior contract of `Survival::craft_once_checked`: pre-send
  failures are now `CraftOnceError::Failed` rather than `OutcomeUnknown`;
  uncertain delivery of an admitted take is reported as `OutcomeUnknown`
  (`RequiresInspection`), carrying the fill record and take identity without
  resending. Public types and signatures are unchanged (#178).
